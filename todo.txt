TO-DO----------------------------------------------------

Features


2) implement parameter dependent thresholding

3) consolidate training loop with more transparency 
    - refactor with loss function?
        - how should quantify loss (train test split)
        - probably train/val/test doesn't make sense
    - how do we define overfitting
        - mainly learning weights that fit a single initial condition

4) visualization
    - dial in 3d-plots
    - plot tangent vectors for x_dot


In-Progress_________________________________________________

1) vectorize jacobian calculation for simulated data
